Sorting

Arr = {{"Anil", 50}, {"Ayan", 80}, {"Piyush", 50}, {"Ramesh", 80}}

stable sorting:
sorting objects in an order.. if two or more objects has same values, then sort them in an order inside themselves..
example : bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort etc

arr = {{"Anil",50}, {"Piyush",50}, {"Ayan", 80}, {"Ramesh", 80}}


unstable sorting:
sorting just occur for one value of an object and do not care about objects having same value.
ex : selection sort, quick sort, heap sort.

arr = {{"Piyush",50}, {"Anil",50}, {"Ayan", 80}, {"Ramesh", 80}}
any order of names are possible but values will be in sorted way
